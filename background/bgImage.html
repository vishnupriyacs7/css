Beneath the silver veil of night,
The moon, a silent sentinel, takes flight.
Its glow spills over hills and streams,
Guiding dreams through midnight's seams.

The stars, like diamonds strewn above,
Weave secrets into the fabric of love.
They twinkle, winking at the earth,
As if sharing tales of celestial mirth.

The night breeze dances with the leaves,
Whispering secrets only darkness believes.
Owls hoot, and crickets play their tune,
While shadows waltz beneath the moon.

In this nocturnal symphony so grand,
Time slows down, as if held by a hand.
The world rests, wrapped in slumber's embrace,
And the night reveals its magic and grace.

So let us linger, hearts attuned,
To the moonlit whispers of the night,
Where dreams take</pre>
